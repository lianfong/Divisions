This is what you can find when you go into a life sciences building: Classes on human biology, chemistry, bio-chemistry, molecular life sciences, microbiology, and physical chemistry. These buildings on campus include the Biology Building, Swain Hall, Chemistry Building, Ballantine Hall, and Simon Hall. Unlike PBS majors, classes aren't bond to one main building and location.
