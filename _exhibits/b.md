This is what you can find when you go into the Psychological and Brain Sciences Building: Classes on neuroscience, social, cognitive, developmental, and abnormal psychology, and many research opportunities. A majority of psychology students are confined to this building as psychology classes take place strictly in PBS; rarely do classes take place in other locations such as Ballantine and Swain Hall, etc since these are core classes. Unlike other majors and schools such as Life Sciences, classes aren't strict to one building and location.
