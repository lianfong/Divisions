This website was created by Lian Fong (the technologist), Nora Daley (the producer), and Erin Vest (the writer) for the express purpose of raising awareness of the Divisions of Indiana University-Bloomington for an Introduction To Popular Culture class (SP23: Intro to Popular Culture: 9314). All images used belong to their original owners in all rights.
It uses open source libraries and frameworks including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/). Wax builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and others.
