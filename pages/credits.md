The Divisions Project was created by Erin Vest, the writer, Nora Daley, the producer, and Lian Fong, the technlogist. This project was made for Yilin La, the class instructor for SP23: Intro to Popular Culture: 9314. It uses open source libraries and frameworks including [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [IIIF](http://iiif.io), [OpenSeaDragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), [Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/), and [ElasticLunr](http://elasticlunr.com/). Wax builds upon work by [Peter Binkley](https://github.com/pbinkley), [David Newbury](https://github.com/workergnome), and others.

We welcome and encourage contributors and maintainers. Please get in touch, or [fork the project on GitHub](https://github.com/minicomp/wax). If you encounter any issue with the software, please [create an issue](https://github.com/minicomp/wax/issues) on our repository or post a comment on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/minicomp/wax/).
