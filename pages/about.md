**Divisions Between Majors and Colleges on Indiana University-Bloomington Campus.**
Indiana University-Bloomington works really hard to make every school feel connected and a collective unit on a large campus, but individual schools work very hard to give their students a sense of a smaller community so it often feels more isolating. This idea is really well seen in the different bulletin boards that can be posted around the different buildings on campus. These bulletin boards should be a good way for the campus as a whole to stay connected but instead the bulletin boards become advertisements for the specific College that the classes in the building belong to.
